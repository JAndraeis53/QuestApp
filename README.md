This is an app called Quest

This is a C# learning exercise:
In this exercise we will don the brightly colored robe and shiny hat of an adventurer and undergo a series of challenges to complete a quest.

Phase 1
In this phase we'll get going with some starter code. We'll add to this initial code in future phases.

Phase 2
Our adventurer is currently named "Jack". Studies show that "Jack" is probably not the application user's name.

Phase 3
This quest is so much fun that everyone is sure to want to do it more than once.

Phase 4
I don't know if you noticed, but our adventurer is naked. What happened to all that talk about a brightly colored robe and shiny hat?

Phase 5
Let's cover that hatless head.

Phase 6
When you think about it, this isn't much of a quest, is it? A quest is supposed to be for something, right?

Phase 7
Let's make the challenges a little more interesting

Phase 8
Add code to record the number of successful challenges the adventurer completes during a quest.
